# Boilerplate and Template Folder

It is recommended to put files that hold credentials or host/environment
dependant items in the folder `/etc/openxpki/local` and do *NOT* add them
to the version control system.

This folder should be used to provide template files to be copied (and
adjusted) to `/etc/openxpki/local`.
